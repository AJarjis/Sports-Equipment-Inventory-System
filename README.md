## What it does?
An inventory system devloped in Java that manages the inventory of a sports equipment company.
Has all the standard features of an inventory system such as adding, removing getting stock count, etc.

## So does it work?
Yes, completely although there is no interface, entirely based in the terminal and must be fed a specific type of

## Why was it made?
Primarily made for coursework during my first year at uni as a way of learning Java which earned me full marks.
